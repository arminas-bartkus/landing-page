**THIS PROJECT IS ODIN PROJECT TRAINING
EXERCISE**

2nd odin project - landing page

This project will incorporate the main foundations
learnt in Foundation course of the Odin Project
(minus the JS!). The main skills I will be
displaying are as follows:

- The use of flexbox and its different properties
 for organising the layout of my project
- incorporating links and images
- changing styling options (such as font-weight,
 font-size)
- sectioning the page into separate parts
with different styling options throughout

With the project now finished, I can reflect
that it was completed successfully. For this
being the first big project, the css is messy
but the html looks good. It got the job done
and probably took way too long but that is 
what learning is about

Return to fix:
- Tidy up CSS, group what can be grouped,
remove unnecessary lines
