# landing-page

2nd odin project - landing page

This project will incorporate the main foundations
learnt in Foundation course of the Odin Project
(minus the JS!). The main skills I will be
displaying are as follows:

- The use of flexbox and its different properties
 fororganising the layout of my project
- incorporating links and images
- changing styling options (such as font-weight,
 font-size)
- sectioning the page into separate parts
with different styling options throughout
